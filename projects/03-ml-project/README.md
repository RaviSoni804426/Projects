# ML Classification Project: Iris Species

This project demonstrates a simple classification task using the Iris dataset and a Random Forest Classifier.

## Features
- Synthetic data generation (Iris dataset)
- Data splitting (Train/Test)
- Model training with Scikit-Learn
- Model evaluation with classification report
- Model serialization (saving to `.pkl`)

## How to Run
1. Activate the environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Output
- Prints accuracy and classification report.
- Saves the trained model to `../../models/iris_rf_model.pkl`.
